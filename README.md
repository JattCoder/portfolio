# Portfolio

Welcome to My Portfolio, in this application, i have used front and back end skills. 

For Fronend  - i have designed and added styles and animation to this application. Added heartbeat, its mentions that coding (front and back)end makes me feel alive, exices me, motivates me to design and build new and different types of application and drop them in marketplace for users to make life easier.
